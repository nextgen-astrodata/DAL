HOW-TO: use the spec file to build a RPM
========================================

Create the rpmbuild directories:
$ yum install rpm-build rpmdevtools
$ rpmdev-setuptree
$ ls ~/rpmbuild

An environment file ~/.rpmmacros has been created as well. Add the following macros to that file:
  %packager <name>
  %vendor <company>

(e.g. LOFARBuild and ASTRON). 

Then to build the DAL rpm:
$ wget -O ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/DAL_v2.6.1.tar.gz https://github.com/nextgen-astrodata/DAL/archive/v2.6.1.tar.gz
$ cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
$ rpmbuild -ba DAL_2.6.1.spec

'rpmbuild -ba' builds both the source package (in ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS) and binary package (in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS).


HOW-TO: use the source package to create a binary package
=========================================================

With the source package a binary package can be created using rpmbuild, the SPEC file in the source package contains all the information that is needed to compile the code:

$ rpmbuild --rebuild DAL-2.6.1-2.el7.src.rpm

Rpmbuild will automatically create the ~/rpmbuild directory and clean it up after the build. 

BEWARE: don't do this as the same user on the same host where you are building your RPM's because the ~/rpmbuild directory will be cleaned up after the build.


HOW-TO: install the binary RPM
==============================

The DAL package is a relocatable package. By default it will install DAL in /opt/DAL:

$ rpm -i DAL-2.6.1-2.el7.x86_64.rpm

To install it in <other_dir>:

$ rpm -i --prefix=<other_dir>  DAL-2.6.1-2.el7.x86_64.rpm
