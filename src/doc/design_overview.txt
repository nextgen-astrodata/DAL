        LDA Design Overview
        ===================

The LOFAR Data Access (LDA) library allows the management of several HDF5 LOFAR data products, implementing the file formats as described in the various ICDs, which are currently available at

        http://lus.lofar.org/wiki/doku.php?id=documents:lofar_data_products

The contents of the LDA is as follows:
        cmake/          - custom scripts for the CMake build environment.
        examples/       - small self-contained programs using the LDA.
        src/            - all of the LDA source code.

        Features
        -----------------

1. ICDs: the LDA aims to implement ICD001 (TBB Time-Series Data) and ICD004 (Beam-Formed Data).

2. Python bindings are available, closely matching the C++ API. Docstrings are generated from the comments included in the header files. Numpy is used for marshalling data sets.

        Build environment
        -----------------

The LDA uses CMake to build and install. The following packages are requires:
        - cmake 2.8+
        - g++
        - make
        - swig
        - libhdf5-*-dev
        - libhdf5-*

For the python bindings, additional packages are needed:        
        - python-dev
        - numpy

To generate documentation and python docstrings:
        - doxygen

        HDF5 in the LDA
        -----------------

The HDF5 file format is a hierarchical structure, consisting of a root `group' (the file itself) which can iteratively contain (sub) groups, forming a tree. Each group can contain a set of `attributes' (key-value pairs). All groups and attributes have a name, which is unique within the encompassing group. High-volume data is stored in special groups called `data sets', which are essentially groups with a single (multidimensional) data set attached. A data set itself thus can have attributes and sub groups as well. All elements are named with a string, typically all-capital. An example HDF5 structure:

        foo.h5                    - root group
        |- NAME                   - attribute (string)
        |- AGE                    - attribute (unsigned integer)
        \- MY_DATASET             - data set (2-dimensional, float)
           \- DESCRIPTION         - attribute (string)

The LDA allows any HDF5 file structure consisting of groups, data sets, and attributes, to be represented as classes in C++ and Python. For example, the LDA easily allows the above structure to be wrapped, such that access through Python can be done as follows:

        f = MyStructure("foo.h5")

        name = f.name().get()
        age  = f.age().get()
        print "File describes %s, age %u" % (name, age)

        dataset    = f.myDataset()
        desc       = dataset.description().get()
        firstValue = dataset.getScalar([0,0])

        print "Dataset is described as %s and the first value is %f" % (description, firstValue)

An HDF5 file in the LDA is thus represented in its abstract form -- the developer does not need to call any HDF5 functions to define, examine, or use a document structure. To do so, LDA defines the following C++ class structure:

        HDF5Node                  - Represents any HDF5 node (attribute/group/dataset/file).
          HDF5NodeSet             - Represents objects which can have HDF5 attributes and subgroups.
            HDF5FileBase          - Wraps an HDF5 file itself (the root group).
            HDF5GroupBase         - Any HDF5 group that is not a root group.
              HDF5DatasetBase<T>  - An HDF5 data set with data of type T.
          AttributeBase           - Common functionality for all attributes.
            Attribute<T>          - An HDF5 attribute (a key/value pair; key = string, value = data type T)

        hid_gc                    - Identifier for any HDF5 object; reference counted and garbage collected
        HDF5Exception             - Thrown in case of errors reported by HDF5

All supported data types are enumerated in hdf5core/h5typemap.h, which provides translations between C++ and HDF5 for:

        float, double,
        short, int, unsigned, bool,
        std::string,
        std::complex<T> (T = a supported scalar type),
        std::vector<T> (T = any of the previous types).

For data sets, the endianness of the data to store can be provided explicitly. For attributes, data is always written in the little-endian format.

The above class structure allows the developer to represent a simple HDF5 structure directly in C++ (and through bindings, in Python as well). For example, the following HDF5 structure is annotated by the classes used in the LDA to represent the individual components:

        HDF5 name:                              C++ type:                               Python type:
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        foo.h5                                  HDF5FileBase                            HDF5FileBase
        |- NAME                                 Attribute<string>                       AttributeString
        |- AGE                                  Attribute<unsigned>                     AttributeUnsigned
        \- MY_DATASET                           HDF5DatasetBase<float>                  HDF5DataseBaseFloat
           \- DESCRIPTION                       Attribute<string>                       AttributeString

Note that for Python, alternate names are needed because < and > are not valid characters.

The HDF5 structure described above can be created and populated in C++ as follows:

        using namespace LDA;
        using namespace std;

        HDF5FileBase f("foo.h5", HDF5FileBase.CREATE);

        Attribute<string> name(f.group(), "NAME");
        name.set("John Doe");

        Attribute<unsigned> age(f.group(), "AGE");
        age.set(21);

        HDF5DatasetBase<float > d(f.group(), "MY_DATASET");
        vector<ssize_t> dims(2,2);
        d.create(dims, dims);

        Attribute<string> desc(d.group(), "DESCRIPTION");
        desc.set("This is an example dataset");

or alternatively, in Python:

        import LDA

        f = LDA.HDF5FileBase("foo.h5", LDA.HDF5FileBase.CREATE)

        name = LDA.AttributeString(f.group(), "NAME")
        name.set("John Doe")

        age = LDA.AttributeString(f.group(), "AGE")
        age.set(21);

        d = LDA.HDF5DatasetBaseFloat(f.group(), "MY_DATASET")
        d.create([2,2],[2,2])

        desc = LDA.AttributeString(d.group(), "DESCRIPTION")
        desc.set("This is an example dataset");

Note that the f.group() and d.group() functions are used to access named elements within those groups. The group() functions provide an identifier for that group, with which child elements can be referenced.

The LDA ships with classes that wrap the HDF5 structures as described in the ICD documents in a similar way. For example, the above structure could be wrapped in C++ classes as follows:

        using namespace LDA;
        using namespace std;

        class MyDataset;

        class MyFile: public HDF5FileBase {
          MyFile(const string &name, enum fileMode mode = READ): HDF5FileBase(name, mode) {}

          Attribute<string>  name() { return Attribute<string>(group(), "NAME"); }
          Attribute<unsigned> age() { return Attribute<unsigned>(group(), "AGE"); }
          MyDataset myDataset()     { return MyDataset(group(), "MY_DATASET"); }
        };

        class MyDataset: public HDF5DatasetBase<float> {
          MyDataset(const hid_gc &parent, const string &name): HDF5DatasetBase<float>(parent, name) {}

          Attribute<string>  description() { return Attribute<string>(group(), "DESCRIPTION"); }
        };

For the ICDs, the following wrappers are available:

        ICD001 - TBB Time-Series Data - LDA class TBB_File
        ICD004 - Beam-Formed Data     - LDA class BF_File

        Python Bindings
        -----------------

The Python bindings of the LDA are generated using SWIG, which parses the C++ header files to define the Python classes. The main advantage of this approach is its light weight, making the bindings easy to maintain.

        Extending the LDA
        -----------------

The HDF5 file-format wrappers provide only low-level access to the astronomical data that the ICDs describe. The LDA classes describing the ICD file formats (TBB_File et al.) can be extended to provide higher-level functionality.
