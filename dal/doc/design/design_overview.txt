        DAL Design Overview
        ===================

The Data Access Library (DAL) allows the management of several HDF5 LOFAR data products, implementing the file formats as described in the various ICDs, which are currently available at

        http://lus.lofar.org/wiki/doku.php?id=documents:lofar_data_products

The contents of the DAL is as follows:
        cmake/          - custom scripts for the CMake build environment.
        examples/       - small self-contained programs using the DAL.
        src/            - all of the DAL source code.

        Features
        -----------------

1. ICDs: the DAL aims to implement ICD001 (TBB Time-Series Data) and ICD003 (Beam-Formed Data).

2. Python bindings are available, closely matching the C++ API. Docstrings are generated from the comments included in the header files. Numpy is used for marshalling data sets.

        Build environment
        -----------------

The DAL uses CMake to build and install. The following packages are requires:
        - cmake 2.8+
        - g++
        - make
        - swig
        - libhdf5-*-dev
        - libhdf5-*

For the python bindings (optional), additional packages are needed:
        - python-dev
        - numpy

To generate documentation and python docstrings (both optional):
        - doxygen

        Scope and Software stack
        ------------------------

The DAL implements the astronomical data format description as described by the ICD documents, and provides functions to implement similar file structures. In diagram form:

        
        +---------------------------+
        | Application               |
        +---------------------------+
        | High-level interpretation |
        +---------------------------+
        | Low-level interpretation  |
        +---------------------------+
        | Structure format          | - provided by the DAL
        +---------------------------+
        | File format               | - provided by the HDF5 library
        +---------------------------+
        | File-system access        | - provided by the Operating System
        +---------------------------+

As the diagram shows, the DAL currently lacks any level of data interpretation (other than type-safety and interface conformance). Low-level interpretation would involve a basic coupling of data fields, to provide physical units instead of C++ data types (for example, jointly interpreting a value field X and a unit field X_UNIT). High-level interpretation would involve expensive calculations based on values across many data fields (for example, generate an image).

        HDF5 in the DAL
        -----------------

The HDF5 file format is a hierarchical structure, consisting of a root `group' (the file itself) which can iteratively contain (sub) groups, forming a tree. Each group can contain a set of `attributes' (key-value pairs). All groups and attributes have a name, which is unique within the encompassing group. High-volume data is stored in special groups called `data sets', which are essentially groups with a single (multidimensional) data set attached. A data set itself thus can have attributes and sub groups as well. All elements are named with a string, typically all-capital. An example HDF5 structure:

        foo.h5                    - root group
        |- NAME                   - attribute (string)
        |- AGE                    - attribute (unsigned integer)
        \- MY_DATASET             - data set (2-dimensional, float)
           \- DESCRIPTION         - attribute (string)

The DAL allows any HDF5 file structure consisting of groups, data sets, and attributes, to be represented as classes in C++ and Python. For example, the DAL easily allows the above structure to be wrapped, such that access through Python can be done as follows:

        f = MyStructure("foo.h5")

        name = f.name().value
        age  = f.age().value
        print "File describes %s, age %u" % (name, age)

        dataset    = f.myDataset()
        desc       = dataset.description().value
        firstValue = dataset.getScalar([0,0])

        print "Dataset is described as %s and the first value is %f" % (description, firstValue)

An HDF5 file in the DAL is thus represented in its abstract form -- the developer does not need to call any HDF5 functions to define, examine, or use a document structure. To do so, DAL defines the following C++ class structure:

        Node                  - Represents any HDF5 node (attribute/group/dataset/file).
          Group           - Any HDF5 group that is not a root group.
            File          - Wraps an HDF5 file itself (the root group).
            Dataset<T>    - An HDF5 data set with data of type T.
          AttributeBase           - Common functionality for all attributes.
            Attribute<T>          - An HDF5 attribute (a key/value pair; key = string, value = data type T)

        hid_gc                    - Identifier for any HDF5 object; reference counted and garbage collected
        HDF5Exception             - Thrown in case of errors reported by HDF5

All supported data types are enumerated in hdf5core/h5typemap.h, which provides translations between C++ and HDF5 for:

        float, double,
        short, int, unsigned, bool,
        std::string,
        std::complex<T> (T = a supported scalar type),
        std::vector<T> (T = any of the previous types).

For data sets, the endianness of the data to store can be provided explicitly. For attributes, data is always written in the little-endian format.

The above class structure allows the developer to represent a simple HDF5 structure directly in C++ (and through bindings, in Python as well). For example, the following HDF5 structure is annotated by the classes used in the DAL to represent the individual components:

        HDF5 name:                              C++ type:                               Python type:
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        foo.h5                                  File                            File
        |- NAME                                 Attribute<string>                       AttributeString
        |- AGE                                  Attribute<unsigned>                     AttributeUInt
        \- MY_DATASET                           Dataset<float>                  HDF5DataseBaseFloat
           \- DESCRIPTION                       Attribute<string>                       AttributeString

Note that for Python, alternate names are needed because < and > are not valid characters.

The HDF5 structure described above can be created and populated in C++ as follows:

        using namespace dal;
        using namespace std;

        File f("foo.h5", File.CREATE);

        Attribute<string> name(f, "NAME");
        name.value = "John Doe";

        Attribute<unsigned> age(f, "AGE");
        age.value = 21;

        Dataset<float > d(f, "MY_DATASET");
        vector<ssize_t> dims(2,2);
        d.create(dims);

        Attribute<string> desc(d.group(), "DESCRIPTION");
        desc.value = "This is an example dataset";

or alternatively, in Python:

        import dal

        f = dal.File("foo.h5", dal.File.CREATE)

        name = dal.AttributeString(f, "NAME")
        name.value = "John Doe"

        age = dal.AttributeString(f, "AGE")
        age.value = 21;

        d = dal.DatasetFloat(f, "MY_DATASET")
        d.create([2,2])

        desc = dal.AttributeString(d, "DESCRIPTION")
        desc.value = "This is an example dataset"

Note that the f and d.group() functions are used to access named elements within those groups. The group() functions provide an identifier for that group, with which child elements can be referenced.

The DAL ships with classes that wrap the HDF5 structures as described in the ICD documents in a similar way. For example, the above structure could be wrapped in C++ classes as follows:

        using namespace dal;
        using namespace std;

        class MyDataset;

        class MyFile: public File {
          MyFile(const string &name, enum fileMode mode = READ): File(name, mode) {}

          Attribute<string>  name() { return Attribute<string>(*this, "NAME"); }
          Attribute<unsigned> age() { return Attribute<unsigned>(*this, "AGE"); }
          MyDataset myDataset()     { return MyDataset(*this, "MY_DATASET"); }
        };

        class MyDataset: public Dataset<float> {
          MyDataset(const hid_gc &parent, const string &name): Dataset<float>(parent, name) {}

          Attribute<string>  description() { return Attribute<string>(*this, "DESCRIPTION"); }
        };

For the ICDs, the following wrappers are available:

        ICD001 - TBB Time-Series Data - DAL class TBB_File
        ICD003 - Beam-Formed Data     - DAL class BF_File

        Python Bindings
        -----------------

The Python bindings of the DAL are generated using SWIG, which parses the C++ header files to define the Python classes. The main advantage of this approach is its light weight, making the bindings easy to maintain.
