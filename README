Data Access Library (DAL) - README
==================================

The DAL provides access to radio astronomy data produced by the LOFAR
telescope, operated by ASTRON (Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy).
DAL is a reference implementation to access all HDF5 data fields with long-term
compatibility in mind. DAL is written in C++ and offers Python bindings for all
its functionality. It also comes with API documentation, a user manual, small
example programs + data, and a test suite.

Source code is available at https://github.com/nextgen-astrodata/DAL

Documentation is available at http://nextgen-astrodata.github.io/DAL

Documents that specify supported data formats are available at
